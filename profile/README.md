We are a friendly group offering support and opportunities to anyone curious about developing their interest or career in weather and climate.

Whether you are a beginner or more experienced coder, we want to help people find coding study buddies and become part of a collaborative coding community over weather and climate.

We are a new club and are busy setting up areas for beginners, portfolio project ideas and how to use open source meteorological data sets.

We have made a start already, with much more to follow! - so if you would like to support our initiatives, or follow what's available as we grow, you can find out how to join us below 👇
